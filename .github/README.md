## Bootstrap 5 (and Bootstrap 4) Support

This child theme uses Bootstrap 5 and requires [Tracomme2023 Parent Theme 1.1](https://wordpress.org/themes/tracomme2023) or greater for best functionality. It does not create JS or CSS files that work with Bootstrap 4 markup. In fact, in the `functions.php` file, this child theme overrides the parent theme's customizer settings.

If you want to build a child theme with Bootstrap 4, please use [the 1.0.1 child theme release](https://github.com/tracomme2023/tracomme2023-child/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as it was the last version built to support Bootstrap 4.
